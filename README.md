## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Including a modern css reset at the start of the stylesheet helps with setting up sensible cross-browser default styles. For example:

```css
img,
picture {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
```

Setting img elements to display block and max-width 100% makes them easier to work with. The only other style I needed to add to the image in the QR code component was a border radius to match the design.

### Useful resources

- [A Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) - This helped me with the cross-browser default styles.

I drew inspiration from the feedback [Grace Snow](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/grace-snow) provided to others who worked on the same project, like including a modern CSS reset and using landmark elements such as `<main>`.
